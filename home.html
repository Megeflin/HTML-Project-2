        <div class="">Tony's Conoco</div>
        <p>As we passed through the cold winter night, the wide expanse of stars and the shadow of the Rocky Mountains surrounded our car as we drove down the road. Our destination was what many call the last great ski town in Colorado: Crested Butte. I grew up here, and it’s a place I’ve always loved and cherished for all that it has meant to my family.
          This night was special. It was my birthday, and my father and I—along with a few friends—were on our way to enjoy a night in Crested Butte. As we talked about our hometown, regaling our guests with stories about this wonderful little hidden gem, naturally we started talking about Tony’s Conoco.</p>
        <p>Tony’s was a place that I remember through the unique and idyllic lens of childhood memories. It was the place my grandfather would take me on a trip to town for errands. But more than that, it was someplace special. Locals always congregated at Tony’s, and every time I went there we’d inevitably stay beyond what a six-year-old could normally tolerate, as my grandfather caught up on all of the town happenings and gossip.</p>
        <p>For me, the best part of going was seeing Tony Mihelich. He was the nice man always wearing overalls, a baseball hat, and a gentle smile, who would give me and any child who came in a lollipop. Whether it was your first lollipop or your twentieth he always kindly gave you your sweet treat and indulged your childish excitement like it was the first time.
        <p>As I shared these happy memories with my friends, my father interjected. “Hey now, Tony may have given you candy but . . . he gave me candy first when I was a kid.” He continued on, telling us of his favorite memories of Tony’s and growing up in Crested Butte in the 1970s. He fondly remembered all of the “old timers” hanging around the hardware store and hearing stories of the mining days. When my uncle and my father decided to build a tree house, they of course went to Tony’s for supplies. When they asked for tenpenny galvanized nails, Tony replied, “Those are on order.” He told them to check back in a few days. Tony was notorious for this as he usually didn’t have all of the supplies everyone asked for and would quickly order them once you stepped out the door. The items “on order” always seemed endless, and the phrase “Those are on order” became notorious in Crested Butte.</p>

        <P>As I listened to my father, it struck me how intrinsic Tony’s was to the community. While I thought about this I wondered what my grandparents’ perspective of Tony’s was, considering they spent close to sixty years in Crested Butte. I asked my grandmother about it.
        <p>She told me, “I remember Tony fondly. He was always working and always friendly. He was so calm; nothing seemed to rattle him. The guys—mostly Yugoslavian first and second generation—sat around the old potbelly stove and shot the breeze.”</p>
        <p>My grandfather wrote in his autobiography   of an early memory he had of Tony’s just after my family moved to the valley in 1960. “We had no garage so I kept the sports car in the back of Tony Mihelich’s Hardware. It was a bit inconvenient, but far better than leaving it out on the street where it might be hit by a snowplow, a not too uncommon experience in the winter. When they’d see me coming to pick up my Porsche, the old timers, huddled around the potbellied stove, would say ‘Look out boys here comes the “Flying Dutchman,”’ and then laugh and laugh!”</p>
        <p>The building itself was built in 1883 by John McCosker and was originally a blacksmith shop but later expanded and became the Crested Butte hardware store. The false-front structure, characteristic of western frontier towns, is one of three remaining wood-frame structures in Crested Butte. Commercially it housed not only the first gas station in town in 1911, but the longest-running business in the community, and the longest independently owned Conoco station in the world (1940–1996). In 1974 it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Crested Butte Historic District. Tony became the sole owner of Crested Butte Hardware and the Conoco station in 1952 and continued to run it until 1996. Not long after Tony shut down the store, sadly, he passed away.</p>
        <p>By 2001 the Crested Butte Heritage Museum was looking for a new location. The museum board decided that Tony’s would be the perfect place. Within a year the funds were raised to purchase the building. In 2003 the museum opened its doors in its new location for locals and tourists alike. It was amazing to step through those doors and once again feel that special feeling I felt as a young child. The museum had kept the building much like it was when it was still a hardware store and I half expected to see Tony there. There was even more to explore and see with all the wonderful exhibits showcasing Crested Butte and its mining, skiing, and mountain-biking history.</p>
        <p>Time and the tough climate of the Rocky Mountains took a physical toll on Tony’s, and it was clear that  the building needed work to preserve its legacy. The museum applied for and received two grants from the State Historical Fund to start the process of preserving and maintaining the integrity of the building. A $15,000 Historical Structure Assessment grant awarded in 2015 was used to review and analyze the current state of the building. From those findings, suggested treatments—using the Secretary of Interior Standards for the rehabilitation and preservation of historic structures as guidelines—were compiled to create a roadmap or a preservation plan of necessary work. In the fall of 2016 the museum was awarded a $200,000 grant from the State Historical Fund for the first of two phases that will focus on the exterior rehabilitation of the building as recommended in the Historical Structure Assessment. The preservation and rehabilitation work that will be done will ensure that the building remains sound for many years to come.</p>
        <p>It’s buildings like Tony’s that physically embody the cultural history of a community. It was clear that the sense of place that Tony and his hardware store provided affected generations of people in our small town. Every memory from my family—and I’m sure so many other locals—focused around the tangible, physical place that was Tony’s. It was the building that housed the local hardware store and gas station, the place where you could catch up on what was happening in town or just remember the good old days, and where every child got a sweet treat from the wonderful owner. Now with the stewardship of the museum and with the help of the State Historical Fund that heritage will continue through to future generations.</p>
